## Future plans:
One of the things I have in mind is to make a pretty considerable improvement, since I didn't spend the time I wanted to, so for now it's a big piece of shit, but I have a big list of things I plan to do with this project.

### Todo:
- [ ] Intregrate Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Rewrite it in Typescript
